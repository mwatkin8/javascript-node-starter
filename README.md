# Javascript-node-starter
This repository is meant to be a template for those who want to use Javascript (NodeJS) to create a FHIR application.

## Instructions
This example is built with NodeJS which must be installed on your computer. 
On MacOS, one way is through Homebrew with the command `brew install node`.

To create the server needed for this example, first install the http-server tool using the command `npm install -g http-server`, 
then navigate to the home directory of javascript-node-starter and launch a new server with the command `http-server -a 0.0.0.0 -p 8080`.

Navigate your web browser to http://0.0.0.0:8080/ in order to view the example.
